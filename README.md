#Midway.js
##Automatically center responsive elements.

Midway.js makes it super easy to automatically center the responsive elements on your websites. You all know and love the absolute positioning centering technique, but what happens when those centered elements change sizes, due to percentage based layouts? That's where Midway.js comes in. Take a look at the example below, and see for yourself!

##Usage

1. Place the following right before </head>
``` html
<script type="text/javascript" src="midway.min.js"></script>
```

2. Add the class `midway-horizontal` and/or `midway-vertical` to center vertically, horizontally, or both.

In use:
``` html
<div class="midway-horizontal midway"></div>
```

##Release Notes

###v1.1
- Call the centering function whenever you would like, rather than just on load and resize. Simply call Midway();
- Midway.js now works with all elements, all the time! No more pesky bugs that would cause the element to be uncentered until you resize the browser.
- Other minor bug fixes.

###v1.2
- Fixed bug in which centering breaks with more than one element being centered the same way.
- Classes renamed from `centerVertical` to `midway-vertical` and `centerHorizontal` to `midway-horizontal`.
- Small performance improvement.
- Demo file added.
